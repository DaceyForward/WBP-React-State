# React State Work Based Problem

## The Scenario

Based on user feedback, the Customer Success Team at your company has determined that a dark mode feature needs to be implemented in the latest update to your company’s website.  You have been tasked with creating a working test of the proposed dark mode button.  Another developer has set up the React application with a non-functioning button and written some tests to enforce the criteria and structure requested by your company.  It is your responsibility to give functionality to that button.

## Requirements

1.  Modify the existing “theme” button to dynamically render the text “Dark Mode” or “Light Mode”

2.  Create an onClick function and some logic that will dynamically update the class of main content and footer.

3.  When finished the background of the page should switch from white to black, as well as invert the font color with every press of the button.

4.  Run the test suite for the react app to check if your automated tests are passing as you work through this task.  You will start with four failing tests and hope to progressively get the tests to pass as you implement state and modify content.


## Steps to complete tickets
1. Fork and clone this repo
2. Make sure to also navigate to this [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/675B5iDp/react-state-wbp)
3. Navigate into the react-dark-mode sub directory and run ‘npm install’ to install the needed dependencies to run your React app and tests.
4. Move your ticket for the clicked state into the “In Progress” column in the Trello board and work through the checklist listed on the ticket.
5. After you complete the checklist for the ticket, move it to the “Done” column and repeat the process for each subsequent ticket.  This exercise is all about repetition and comfort with creating and modifying state in React.

## Trello Board
When working through this scenario make sure to follow a pattern of tracking your specific, component based tasks in Trello.  When working on a task make sure to move the associated ticket to the "In Progress" column.  Once you have successfully gotten the test to pass for a specific component you are free to move that ticket to "Done".  Make sure to work on only one ticket at a time.
